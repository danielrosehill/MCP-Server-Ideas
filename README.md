## Purpose

This repository is for personal reference and to track progress on various MCP server implementations. Each linked document contains notes, API references, and implementation details for the corresponding service.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between AI systems and external servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend AI capabilities. MCP servers can provide:

- Access to specialized tools and APIs
- Real-time data from external sources
- Domain-specific knowledge and functionality

Feel free to explore the individual service documents for more details on each implementation plan.
