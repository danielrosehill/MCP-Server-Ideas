## Overview

Homebox is a home inventory system that helps users track and manage their possessions. It provides an OpenAPI-compliant API that can be leveraged to create an MCP server for AI systems to interact with home inventory data.

## API Resources

The Homebox API provides functionality for:

- Managing inventory items
- Organizing items by location, category, and tags
- Tracking item details (purchase date, value, warranty, etc.)
- Managing locations and storage spaces
- Searching and filtering inventory

## MCP Server Implementation Plan

### Proposed Tools

1. **add-item**: Add a new item to the inventory
2. **update-item**: Update an existing item's details
3. **search-inventory**: Search for items based on various criteria
4. **manage-locations**: Create, update, or retrieve location information
5. **generate-reports**: Generate inventory reports

### Resources to Expose

1. **inventory-data**: Access to inventory information
2. **location-hierarchy**: Access to location structure
3. **category-taxonomy**: Access to category organization

## Implementation Notes

- The OpenAPI-compliant manifest simplifies implementation
- Authentication will require API key management
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement proper error handling for API responses
